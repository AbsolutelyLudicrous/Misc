Alright
Alright
Alright
(Now ladies!)
I can't quite configure sshd
But, what I've learned so far is:
	man sshd-config does what you would expect
	the Fish server's sshd_config looks pretty similar to mine, but theirs works???
	OSX does weaird things to sshd, it doesn't look similar to one on a *nix system
	systemctl (action) sshd.service controls the sshd

Here's root's bash_history after I gave up:
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /home/masondanne/Documents/Documentation/sshd_config.default
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	ls /etc/ssh/
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	sudo systemctl restart sshd.service 
	man sshd_config 
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	sudo systemctl restart sshd.service 
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	less .bashrc
	w
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	sudo systemctl restart sshd.service 
	man sshd_config 
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

IDK, try again later

It is now later!
