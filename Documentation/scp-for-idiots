First, RTFM.
Because the manual sucks, read this next.
STEP ONE:
	Choose your flags.  You probably don't need them, but if you do, choose them now.
STEP 2WO:
	Locate your file.
STEP THR33:
	Choose your destination server.
STEP 4444:
	Choose your destination location.

Now, the format:
	scp [source-location] [user]@[server]:[destination]
source-location will usually look like /foo/bar/baz/qux/quux.corge
user is your username at the server
server is your remote box
destination is where you want to jam the file after you've copied it
