Let's preface this with my bash_history from when I was dicking around with this

Thank Dog that I stuck those comments in there
I was getting somewhere by the end

So:
	xdotool - simulate key presses
	Not quite what I want, but okay

	xrandr - adjusts brightness at the software, not the hardware level
	It was a start

	setpci - ???
	Just flat out didn't work

	xbacklight/light - adjusts backlight
	Just what I want, right?  Nope, doesn't work in Kernel 4.9

That leaves us with tht last command:
	echo 'p' | sudo -S su -c 'echo 937 > brightness'
Let's dissect that.
	echo 'p' | sudo -S
	Echo my password to sudo, no user input required

	sudo -S su -c
	Log in as root and perform the following command
	
	'echo 937 > brightness'
	This is where it gets weird
		echo [arg] > [file]
		Self explanatory, overwrite the file with arg

		937
		The maximum brightness of an Asus K501UW laptop.  Ranges from 0-937.

		brightness
		/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness - the file where the computer's brightness is stored

	And by golly it worked!
	Kinda.
	I couldn't find a way to decrement the brightness, so:

WHERE DO WE GO NOW?:
	Instead of having brightness increment/decrement keys, just have presets.
	I'm currently thinking that F5 should be half-brightness, F6 full brightness, and F7 is brightness value of 50.
	Eventually, I should find a way to have F8(?) open a brightness slider dialog, similar to the one in Settings/Power/Brightness
	But those are all Future Me's problems.
	Screw you, Future Me!  You probably suck more than current me!

Update!  There's been a breakthrough!  Screw you, Past Me!  You're an Asshole!

Just chmod the thing!

Update!  Five minutes later!
Nope, wasn't the problem.  Still resorting to hacky scripts.
